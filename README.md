## Daily Log

### Day 1:
- **What I learned:**
  - **Introduction to Rust:** Gained an understanding of what Rust is and its core concepts.
  - **Installation:** Installed Rust on a Windows computer.
  - **Basic Programming:** Wrote a simple "Hello, World!" program in Rust.

- **Tools Used:**
  - **Cargo:**
    - Created a new Rust project using `cargo new project_name`.
    - Built and ran the project with `cargo build` and `cargo run`.
    - Checked the code for errors using `cargo check`.

- **Challenges:**
  - Getting familiar with the Cargo toolchain and understanding the `cargo check` output.

### Day 2:
- **What I learned:**
  - **Guessing Game:** Created a guessing game where a random number is generated, and the user must input guesses until they correctly guess the number.
  - **Dependencies:** Learned how to add dependencies in the `Cargo.toml` file.
  - **Variables:** Gained an understanding of immutable and mutable variables in Rust.
  - **Control Flow:** Explored how the `match` and `loop` constructs work in Rust.

- **Challenges:**
  - Implementing the guessing logic and ensuring the game runs smoothly with proper user input handling.
  - Understanding the differences and use cases for immutable vs. mutable variables.

### Day 3:
- **What I learned:**
  - **Variables and Mutability:** Deepened understanding of variables and their mutability in Rust.

- **Challenges:**
  - Applying the concept of mutability in different scenarios to understand when and how to use mutable variables effectively.


### Day 4:
- **What I learned:**
  - **Data Types in Rust:**
    - Explored different data types including signed and unsigned integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, and strings.
    - Learned about complex data types like tuples and arrays.

- **Challenges:**
  - Understanding the differences between various data types and their usage scenarios.
  - Practicing with tuples and arrays to manipulate and access data effectively.
